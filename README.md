# Diff

This library currently houses a C++ implementation of the [Meyers Diff algorithm](http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf). The implementation is header-only and requires C++17 or later. It comes with a small battery of tests (which could be improved upon).

The Meyers implementation is a refinement of a [previous work](https://github.com/gritzko/myers-diff), which itself was a refinement from [another](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch).

Long-term, this library could contain C++ implementations of other diff algorithms, were they valuable.
